## Overview

Cryptography is the backbone of blockchain technology, ensuring security, privacy, and trust in decentralized systems. This repository explores the fundamental cryptographic algorithms and protocols used in blockchains, including hashing, digital signatures, public-key cryptography, and more.

---

## Features

- **Hands-on code examples** for cryptographic algorithms
- **Step-by-step explanations** of key concepts
- **Jupyter notebooks/scripts** for interactive learning (if applicable)
- **Real-world blockchain use cases** for each cryptographic primitive
- **Well-documented code** for easy understanding

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Javascript (or your language of choice)
- Basic understanding of programming

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaitanyaBytes/cryptography.git
   cd cryptography
   ```

2. **Install JavaScript dependencies (if any):**
   ```bash
   cd javascript
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build Rust code:**
   ```bash
   cd rust
   cargo build
   ```

---

### 1. **Project Structure Example**

Replace the Python-centric structure with one that matches your folders:

```markdown
cryptography/
├── javascript/
│   ├── hash_functions/
│   │   └── sha256_example.js
│   ├── digital_signatures/
│   │   └── ecdsa_example.js
│   └── ...
├── rust/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── lib.rs
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── ...
├── README.MD
└── .gitignore
```
